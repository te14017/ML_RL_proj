Meeting on 1st, Dec
Participant: Yves, Theo, Victoria

Project report structure:

1. Introduction to the problem
    1.1 Problem desctiption: Easy21
    1.2 Algorithm selection: SARSA, Q-learning, Multi-Step TD
    1.3 Implementation

2. Algorithm experiment & Parameter tuning
    experiment with SARSA, Q-learning and Multi-Step, report parameter's influence on robot's behavior
    (learning rate, exploration rate etc.)

3. Algorithm comparison and discussion
    compare those 3 algorithms using figures (such as sum of rewards, see the slides)
    discuss their difference

@ Yves:
comparison measurements investigation
output code development (code for producing figures), create another branch

@ Theo:
Implement the other 2 algorithms

@ Victoria & Lily:
Answer question sheet, structure report (upload to google drive for cooperate)
parameter experiment and report(After we finish implementation)
